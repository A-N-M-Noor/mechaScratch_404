# 3D printable files
This directory contains all the 3D files for 3D printing the robot. All the models are optimized to print without support, and with a low amount of infill to ensure a quick print.

## Instruction
The names of the STL files indicate the number of printed parts needed and the strength requirement.

Example file name:

`FrontWheel (2x) (Mid).stl`

Here, `(2x)` indicates this model needs to be printed twice. And `(Mid)` indicates the strength required for the printed part.

* Weak:
  - Infill: Low
  - Walls/Perimeters: 3
  - Top. Bottom layers: 3
* Mid:
  - Infill: High
  - Walls/Perimeters: 5
  - Top. Bottom layers: 3
* Strong:
  - Infill: High
  - Walls/Perimeters: 5
  - Top. Bottom layers: 5

## Assembly
Final assembly should look like this:
