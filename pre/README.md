# Getting Started
We are using a **NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit** for object detection, and an **ESP32 Microcontroller** for the sensors and for handling the controls. So before anything, you must set up your Jetson Nano and ESP32.

## Setting up the Jetson Nano
Detailed instructions can be found on [NVIDIA's official website](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit)

The **NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit** is a small single-board computer. You'll need to flash an operating system (usually Ubuntu) in a micro SD card and insert it into the Jetson Nano. So, you'll need - 
* A micro SD card (32GB or 64GB)
* Micro-USB supply/adapter (Should be at least 10W)
* USB keyboard and mouse
* Computer display with HDMI cable (You can use a VGA Cable too, but you'll need an HDMI to VGA Converter)

### Flashing an SD card
To prepare your microSD card, youâ€™ll need a computer with an Internet connection and the ability to read and write SD cards via a built-in SD card slot or adapter.
1. Download the [Jetson Nano Developer Kit SD Card Image](https://developer.nvidia.com/jetson-nano-sd-card-image)
2. Format your SD card
3. Install an image writer application. We've used [Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/)
4. Click **Select Image** and select the image file you've downloaded just now.

5. Insert your SD card and select the SD drive from **Select Drive**, then click **Flash!**

6. After it's done flashing the image, you can eject your SD card from your device.

### Setup and First Boot
Insert the SD card in the SD slot of your jetpack and power it up. For the first boot, you'll need to use a monitor, keyboard and mouse. Also, connect a wifi dongle to the jetpack if you don't have the network card installed with it.
