## Electrical design of our robot.
To achieve the highest possible efficiency and reliability, we have spent several hundred hours researching and developing the parts. The following paragraphs provide detailed information about electrical systems design.
## Mechanical Design.

We used Ackerman steering as it is a vital steering geometry concept that enhances the handling and cornering performance of vehicles, making them safer and more efficient on the road. Ackerman steering, also known as Ackerman geometry or Ackerman principle, is a steering mechanism which is used in vehicles in order to enable proper turning of the wheels while maintaining optimal geometry and minimizing tire scrubbing during turns. It is commonly used in most modern vehicles, including cars, trucks, and other wheeled vehicles.
The fundamental idea behind Ackerman steering is that the inner and outer wheels of a vehicle must follow different turning radii during a turn, considering the varying angles of the front wheels. When a vehicle turns, the inner wheel needs to negotiate a tighter radius than the outer wheel to maintain a smooth turn without dragging or scuffing the tires. The Ackerman steering mechanism achieves this by using a steering linkage that connects the wheels. Typically, it consists of two tie rods connected to the steering arms on each wheel. The tie rods are connected to a central steering mechanism, such as a steering rack or a pitman arm, which is controlled by the driver. As the driver turns the steering wheel, the steering mechanism transfers the motion to the tie rods, causing the wheels to rotate accordingly. The geometry of the Ackerman steering mechanism ensures that the inner wheel turns at a sharper angle compared to the outer wheel, allowing both wheels to trace their respective turning radii accurately. By implementing Ackerman steering, vehicles can achieve better maneuverability, stability, and reduced tire wear during turns. It ensures that all wheels maintain proper contact with the road surface and minimizes the likelihood of skidding or slipping during turns.
